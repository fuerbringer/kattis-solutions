* Kattis Solutions
  An assorted set of solutions to the various algorithmic and mathematical problems on [[https://open.kattis.com][Kattis]].
  Each directory in this repository contains one solution to a problem. The directory name will usualy correspond with the URL slug on Kattis.
  
  This repository serves as a playground to tinker with new languages and expand my algorithmic skills.
  
** Programming languages
   Most problems thus far were solved using C++. Some in C, and a few using Haskell. In the latter two languages I wouldn't yet consider myself a proficient user.
   
** Disclaimer
   Unaware of Kattis' potential anti-cheating measures I can't guarantee you not getting "punished" by using my solutions using your Kattis account.
