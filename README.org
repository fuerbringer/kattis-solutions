* Kattis Solutions
  An assorted set of solutions to the various algorithmic and mathematical problems on [[https://open.kattis.com][Kattis]].
  Each directory in this repository contains one solution to a problem. The directory name will usualy correspond with the URL slug on Kattis.
  
  This repository serves as a playground to tinker with new languages and expand my algorithmic skills.
** Build instructions
*** C++ and C
    At the time of writing the C/C++ solutions do not yet have Makefiles. They can however very easily be built using:
#+BEGIN_SRC
g++ -Wall -g -O2 -std=gnu++14 solution.c && ./a.out
#+END_SRC
*** PHP
#+BEGIN_SRC
php solution.php
#+END_SRC
